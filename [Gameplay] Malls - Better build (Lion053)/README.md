# Malls - Better Build (Lion053)

## What this mod does

- In vanilla game, only the public service ranges of the Malls with the same recipe are displayed at the same time. And, while building a new blank Mall, no public service is shown at all. Both makes it difficult to recognize where a Mall is missing and where not, especially if you use different recipes.

- With this mod, while building a Mall or after the selection of any, the public-service ranges of all already existing Malls of the same type (Department, Furniture or Pharmacy)
are displayed at the same time, no matter which recipe was chosen (or blank).
- Example: If you click on / or while you build a Furniture Store of any recipe (or blank), the public service ranges of all other already built Furniture stores are shown.

- That means: All consumption buff and public service ranges are changed from Radius to Street Distance
- Furthermore, the smaller productivity buffs provided between 50 % and 199 % productivity are not applied anymore, since they are not shown in the output-infotip anyway
- Instead, only the highest buff, which is regularly provided at 200 % productivity, is provided, but in return already at 101 % productivity (electricity still mandatory)
- The public service is provided from 50 % upwards like in vanilla.

## What to do after you removed this mod from an existing save (but why would you do that :-p)

- Drug stores which existed before you removed this mod and had a recipe active, will work like they did before you installed this mod.
- However, because of the way this mod is implemented, the game will crash as soon as you click on such an existing drug store.
- **Solution: Demolish the drug store and rebuild it.**
- Drug stores without a selected recipe (blanks) are fine and do not need to be demolished.

## Mod Compatibility

- It is compatible with Jakob's Small Malls (from Jakob's City Variations) and New Horizons
- It is not compatible with mods which change buff and public service ranges of the vanilla malls.
