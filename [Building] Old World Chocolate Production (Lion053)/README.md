# OW Chocolate Production (Lion053)

This mod lets you produce chocolate and its ingredients in the Old World.

**Production-Chain**

To produce chocolate by an industrial chocolate factory in the Old World you need Cocoa, Sugar and Milk as inputs:

- Sugar: Produced either by an industrial Sugar Refinery in the Old World or as usual by the basegame building in the New World.
- In the Old World the Sugar Refinery processes Sugar Beets instead of Sugar Cane by default.
- Sugar beets can be produced by the Sugar Beets Farm in the Old World.
- Milk: Produced by the cattle pastures of the basegame cattle farm (which is only graphically slightly adapted). Without DLC-12 this is true for the Old and New World, with DLC-12 active, the New World stays untouched regarding milk. Each pasture module produces 1 ton of milk each cycle. The milk is then teleported into island storage. If the production of the main building stops due to full output or island storage of beef (or cattle if certain mods are active), the pastures will still produce milk.
- Cocoa: Still only producable in the New World.

**Fertility**

- New game: Sugar beets fertility spawns on islands just like the others.
- Existing game: Use fertility items which provide Sugar Beets Fertility. Alternatively the Research Institute can be used to change the fertility of course.

**Items**

- There are six new items: Three legendary specialist, two fertility and one machine item. Check the pictures on mod.io to see their stats and how to get them.
- Worth mentioning at this point: Willy Wonka is ONLY obtainable via Golden Tickets in the Grand Gallery.

**Extra-Building**

- "Chocolaterie Garibaldi": This small building consumes the same inputs as the chocolate factory, but with a high cycle-time. In return it provides a buff to all investor and tourist houses within its radius (when the productivity reaches at least 50 %).

**Menu location**

- Just where the chocolate production chain is (investors and consumables tab).
- The sugar beets farm and sugar refinery can be selected in all other production chains where sugar is needed as well (cognac, lemonade, chewing gum).

**Unlock**

- When chocolate is unlocked, in the basegame this is at 1.750 investors.
- Creative mode: From the start.

**Changelog**

*1.3*
- "Milk from cattle farm" logic has changed:
  - You can build more than 4 pastures per cattle farm while holding **SHIFT**. This way you can increase the milk output per cattle farm without spawning another cattle farm and relying on transporters / streets (since milk is teleported into area storage)
  - To balance this, the cycle time of each pasture has increased.
  - Additionally each pasture increases the maintenance costs of the cattle farm by 5 farmers and 10 coins.
- Fixed chewing gum chain when other mods which change this chain are active
- Add sugar refinery and sugar cane farm into production chain of Donny Bresko's "Old Wiklays Gum" mod

*1.2*

- Fixed too high transporter ranges of sugar beet farms and chocolate factories
- Sugar beet farm fields have a bigger radius within they are allowed to be built

*1.1*

- Add Chinese translation, thanks to hanthe2th!
