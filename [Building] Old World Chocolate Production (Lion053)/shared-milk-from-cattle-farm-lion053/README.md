# Shared-Milk-from-Cattle-Farm (Lion053)

With this mod cattle farm pastures produce Milk...

- by 1 ton per cycle per pasture (cycle time = 240 seconds)
- independently from their main farm building: if beef production stops, the pastures continue to produce milk until island storage is full
- without requiring a street connection: Milk output is teleported into area storage

You can build more than 4 pastures per cattle farm while holding **SHIFT**.
This way you can increase the milk output per cattle farm without spawning another cattle farm and relying on transporters / streets.
To balance this, each pasture increases the maintenance costs of the cattle farm by 5 farmers and 10 coins (while a cattle farm with no pastures at all requires 5 farmers).
That means: A cattle farm with 4 pastures requires 25 farmers, while a cattle farm with e.g. 8 pastures requires 45 farmers.

The cattle farm model in the Old World is graphically slightly adapted to take milk production into account.

Without DLC-12 (New World Rising) this mod applies for the Old and New World.
With DLC-12 active, the New World stays untouched regarding milk (electricity mechanics are used).
