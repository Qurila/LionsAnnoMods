## Enbesa Spectacles Production

This mod adds the possibility to produce spectacles in Enbesa. Therefore it adds a custom sand mine, a soda factory, a glass maker and a spectacles factory. The soda factory is meant to provide a new demand for the vast amount of unused pearls that some Old-World-items generate as an additional output.

For the soda factory there is a new epic item, which is available at Ketema´s trading post or via the Research Institute.

**Why Soda?** 

*Soda is the common name of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), a salt of carbonic acid. It occurs naturally as a mineral in small amounts, but due to its importance in numerous industrial processes it also has to be produced artificially. Whether as a flux in glass production or as a component of detergents, soda is one of the most important chemical raw materials today. Large-scale production began at the end of the 18th century with the Leblanc process, which soon turned out to be harmful to the environment. In 1860, the chemist Ernest Solvay invented a new process that reduced environmental pollution: the "ammonia soda" or "Solvay process". Basically it requires calcium carbonate (lime) (pearls are nothing else), CO2, a lot of water, sodium chloride (salt) and ammonia (which mostly stays in the process and is reused). Today, however, with new technical possibilities, the Leblanc process is also gaining interest again. As part of this mod, the real process is greatly simplified, just as pearls are not a realistic source of lime. But in Anno 1800 there are tons of them like sand by the sea... :D*
