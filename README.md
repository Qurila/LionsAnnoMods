![subway_network_banner](./_sources/banner.jpg)

### How a subway network is supposed to work 

1. Build a Metropolitan Transport Department (MTD). Once built, all other buildings of this mod get unlocked.
2. Build a Subway Depot. Supply it with Tools.
3. Produce Subways with the Subway Factory and its modules.
4. Produce Tickets with the Tickets Recipe Factory.
5. Build midsize or large Subway Stations. Every station is a monument with 2 phases.
6. Supply your finished stations with Subways, Tickets and Lightbulbs. Output will be the public service "Subway".
7. Upgrade your MTD after reaching a certain number of subway stations (quest tells you when and where) to get access to better level-buffs.

### Metropolitan Transport Department (MTD):

- One department per island is allowed.
- There are 3 upgrade stages, which are unlocked at 5, 10 and 15 stations (per island). When a MTD is ready for an upgrade, you recieve a quest, so you can't miss it. To upgrade, you have to use the upgrade tool from your tool-bar.
- Each stage enables a certain Subway Network Level (4 in total: default + 3 upgrades). Each Level comes with certain buffs. These buffs are spreaded by the Subway Stations.
- You can change the visual appearance of higher stages to the visual appearance of lower stages if you want (default hotkey is Ctrl V).
- If you demolish all of your departments (globally), all mod buildings will be locked in the menu, until you build a department again.

### Subway Stations:

- Midsize and Large Subway Stations mainly differ in tile size: 3x3 vs. 3x5. Range and buffs are the same.
- Once their monument stages are finished and they are supplied with their demanded input goods, they provide their public service and buffs within their street range.
- There are 11 skins available for the large subway station and 6 skins for the midsize subway station.
- You may want to give your stations a name in the UI (default is Baker Street; random dice is deactivated)

### Subway Factory and its Modules:

The Subway Factory produces Subways from Motors, Glass and Steel. It can be used as a stand-alone building or in combination with modules.
Subway Fctory Modules require workforce and cost maintenance, some of them additionally require input goods. In return modules provide certain buffs within radius and / or output goods:

1. Factory Entrance Module: Input (Police Equipment) = Output (when processing: Buff on subway factory and modules)
2. Administration Office Module: Input (Telephones, Typewrighters, Paper) = Output (when processing: Buff on subway factory and modules)
3. Material Development Module: Presocketed action-items, which can be (de)activated by the player = Changes inputs of other modules to more complicated ones, in return provides buffs.
4. Pressworks Module: Input (Steel, Tallow) = Output (Metal Sheets) + (when processing: Buff on subway factory + change its input from Steel to Metal Sheets)
5. Cable Factory Module: Input (Copper, Caoutchouc) = Output (Cables) + (when processing: Buff on subway Factory)
6. Motor Assembly Plant Module: Input (Cables, Glass, Steel) = Output (Motors) + (when processing: Buff on subway factory)
7. Warehouse Module: 4 transporter slots, +25 tons storage capacity
8. All other Modules: No Input = Output (Buff on subway factory)

For some modules there are skins available. In most cases the only difference is, whether the building adapts to terrain height or not.

Exception: For the "Connection Tower" module there are variations available instead of a skin to automatically adapt to their neighbor. However this only works for same sized buildings. If the tile size is different, place the tower and all the neighbors first, then select the "Connection Tower" with the "Relocate Tool" and just drop it again. The tower module has now adapted to the neighbors.

### Printing Factory:

- Tickets can be produced by three different recipes. All of them require paper, which can be produced in Enbesa (Land of Lions DLC) or in the Old World via the Advanced Paper Mill mod(included in this mod). The recipes differ in the used pigment / dye (Coal, Indigo (Land of Lions DLC) or Mineral Pigments (New World Rising DLC)).
- Three skins with a different wall and roof color are available per recipe.

# Enbesa Tourism

This mod takes the tourists to Enbesa.

### How do tourists work in Enbesa

**1.** Build a tourist pier to enable the Tourists. This will also enable the vanilla visitor mechanic, so you will get specialists from time to time depending on your island's attractiveness.

**2.** In Enbesa tourists live in a Lodge. A Lodge consists of its Main Building and its Lodge Modules. While the Main Building provides a service to your tourists, the modules are their actual residence (4 variations).

**3.** Fulfill the needs of your tourists. These include some consumable products from Enbesa, the Old as well as the New World. However, the focus is on public service buildings, which are listed below:

- Tourism Pier: Unlike to the Old World, the service is provided by street. There´s no bus connection needed.
- Lodge Main Building
- Market: the vanilla market does the trick, but for those who prefer a smaller footprint there are 3x1 streetmarkets with a smaller range as well.
- Restaurant and Bar: Choose from 4 local recipes each. The recipes provide small buffs to Shepherds and Elders (& Extended Families with Safari to Old Enbesa).
- Airballoon Tour: In order to provide its service, this building needs sails as input.
- Souvenir Shop: In order to provide its service, this building needs chronicles, tapestries and ceramics as inputs.
- Nationalpark (see below for details)

<details>
<summary><b>Details</b> <i>Click to expand</i></summary>

###
**4.** Nationalpark: Consists of its Main Building and its modules:

- The Main Building provides its service via street range. By default this range is very short, so you are forced to build Nationalpark Modules.
- There are 10 different modules, representing the different biomes of Enbesa: Miombo Woodlands, Teeming Lakes, Proud Savannah, Enbesan Highlands and Great Desert.
- Each module on an island increases the public service range of each Main Building on an island. The current range buff is shown via infotip when you click on a Main Building.
- Additionally, to force you to build different modules, each of them provide a different hotspot need. Like in the Old World, hotspot needs are provided by bus: Connect the Pier, your Nationalpark modules and your Lodge modules via bus to fullfill your tourist's hotspot needs. This is your actual "Safari" through a Nationalpark.

**5.** Bus: To establish a bus connection between the Pier, Nationalpark modules and Lodge modules build bus stops. When you first build a bus stop, Ketema should prompt you to click on a bus stop and change the bus skin to the Safari Bus.

**6.** To annoy you a bit, Lodge modules and Nationalpark modules are not for free. Both require build permits which can be obtained by the Tourism Authority. By assigning different tasks to it, you can:

- discover wildlife hotspots aka build permits for Nationalpark modules
- develop build permits to construct more lodge modules (at game start you get 3 for free)
- acquire specialists who can work in Enbesa

**7.** If you want to decorate your lodge complexes or nationalparks, you can choose from some dedicated tourist ornaments. Some ornaments have variations (Ctrl V) or skins. Vanilla ornaments now also provide a small amount of attractiveness.

**8.** When you have built at least 20 Nationalpark Modules, all of your Old (and New) World Tourists who are provided with a Tourism Pier will now also be provided with a Zoo. They rather go on a Safari :D

**Unlock**

- Enbesa Tourism gets unlocked at 4.000 tourists in the Old World AND 300 Scholars in the Old World.
- This ensures, that there is no mess with vanilla tourist quests and that all necessary products to fulfill Enbesa tourist basic needs are already unlocked.

# Old World Chocolate Production

This mod lets you produce chocolate and some of its ingredients in the Old World.

![chocolate_ow](./_sources/chocolate.png)

To produce chocolate by an industrial chocolate factory in the Old World you need Cocoa, Sugar and Milk as inputs:

- Sugar: Produced either by an industrial Sugar Refinery in the Old World or as usual by the basegame building in the New World.
- In the Old World the Sugar Refinery processes Sugar Beets instead of Sugar Cane by default.
- Sugar beets can be produced by the Sugar Beets Farm in the Old World (fertility required).
- Milk: Produced by the cattle pastures of the basegame cattle farm (which is only graphically slightly adapted). Without DLC-12 this is true for the Old and New World, with DLC-12 active, the New World stays untouched regarding milk. Each pasture module produces 1 ton of milk each cycle. The milk is then teleported into island storage. If the production of the main building stops due to full output or island storage of beef (or cattle if certain mods are active), the pastures will still produce milk.
- Cocoa: Still only producable in the New World.

###
**Fertility**

- New game: Sugar beets fertility spawns on islands just like the others.
- Existing game: Use fertility items which provide Sugar Beets Fertility. Alternatively the Research Institute can be used to change the fertility of course.

**Items**

- There are six new items: Three legendary specialist, two fertility and one machine item. Check the pictures on mod.io to see their stats and how to get them.
- Worth mentioning at this point: Willy Wonka is ONLY obtainable via Golden Tickets in the Grand Gallery.

**Extra-Building**

- "Chocolaterie Garibaldi": This small building consumes the same inputs as the chocolate factory, but with a high cycle-time. In return it provides a buff to all investor and tourist houses within its radius (when the productivity reaches at least 50 %).

**Menu location**

- Just where the chocolate production chain is (investors and consumables tab).
- The sugar beets farm and sugar refinery can be selected in all other production chains where sugar is needed as well (cognac, lemonade, chewing gum).

**Unlock**

- When chocolate is unlocked, in the basegame this is at 1.750 investors.
- Creative mode: From the start.
