# Mods for Anno 1800

## How to use

Download the zipped mods you want from the "releases" section on the right and extract them to your Anno mods folder. 
Some mods can be tweaked with the mod-manager I-mod-your-Anno (IMYA). 

## Old World Chapel

This mod adds a chapel to the Old World. It fulfills the luxury need for a church, farmers have from now on, when reached 200 farmers. Range is smaller than the one from the vanilla workers church; you can tweak it with IMYA. 


## Paper Mill Old World

This mod allows you to produce paper in the Old World. Therefore you can choose between different recipes. The first one is unlocked at 750 workers, the second one at 750 engineers. The more advanced the production process the higher the output, but also the more advanced the required input materials. Read the ReadMe for a more detailed recipe description. 

This mod is considered as a shared mod, so feel free to add more recipes and / or change the buildings appearance. You'll find a short "How to" in the assets.xml.


## Small Bus Stop 

This mod adds a small bus stop (2x1 tiles) as an alternative to the 2x3 sized vanilla bus stop as well as a red and a yellow doubledecker as bus skins. In the menu the small bus stop is located next to the vanilla one and unlocked at the same time.



#### Hard Requirement: 
- Tourist DLC


## Enbesa Spectacles Production

This mod adds the possibility to produce spectacles (glasses) in Enbesa. Therefore it adds a custom sand mine, a soda factory, a glass maker and a spectacles factory. The soda factory is meant to provide a new demand for the vast amount of unused pearls that some Old-World-items generate as an additional output.

For the soda factory there is a new epic item, which is available at Ketema´s trading post or via the Research Institute.

<details>
  <summary><b>Why Soda?</b> <i>Click to expand</i></summary> 

*Soda is the common name of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), a salt of carbonic acid. It occurs naturally as a mineral in small amounts, but due to its importance in numerous industrial processes it also has to be produced artificially. Whether as a flux in glass production or as a component of detergents, soda is one of the most important chemical raw materials today. Large-scale production began at the end of the 18th century with the Leblanc process, which soon turned out to be harmful to the environment. In 1860, the chemist Ernest Solvay invented a new process that reduced environmental pollution: the "ammonia soda" or "Solvay process". Basically it requires calcium carbonate (lime) (pearls are nothing else), CO2, a lot of water, sodium chloride (salt) and ammonia (which mostly stays in the process and is reused). Today, however, with new technical possibilities, the Leblanc process is also gaining interest again. As part of this mod, the real process is greatly simplified, just as pearls are not a realistic source of lime. But in Anno 1800 there are tons of them like sand by the sea... :D*
