# Culture Modules as Ornaments (Lion053)

## Buildings

Let you build all culture modules from the museum and botanic garden as well as some from the zoo infinitely without items.

Menu is structered into seven sub groups:

- Botany Water Modules
- Botany Tree Modules
- Museum Temples Modules
- Museum Mosaik Modules
- Museum Miscellaneous
- Zoo: Mammals
- Zoo: Birds and animals with pool modules

Each module comes with +25 attractiveness. This value can be tweaked with IMYA. 

Mod includes modules from Arctic, Cape and Enbesa DLCs, so if you didnÂ´t buy them, you can use the mod, but you might get some empty slots while changing module variations.
