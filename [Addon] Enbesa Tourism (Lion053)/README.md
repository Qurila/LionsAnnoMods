# Enbesa Tourism (Lion053)

This mod takes the tourists to Enbesa.

## How do tourists work in Enbesa

**1.** Build a tourist pier to enable the Tourists. This will also enable the vanilla visitor mechanic, so you will get specialists from time to time depending on your island's attractiveness.

**2.** In Enbesa tourists live in a Lodge. A Lodge consists of its Main Building and its Lodge Modules. While the Main Building provides a service to your tourists, the modules are their actual residence (4 variations).

**3.** Fulfill the needs of your tourists. These include some consumable products from Enbesa, the Old as well as the New World. However, the focus is on public service buildings, which are listed below:

- Tourism Pier: Unlike to the Old World, the service is provided by street. ThereÂ´s no bus connection needed.
- Lodge Main Building
- Market: the vanilla market does the trick, but for those who prefer a smaller footprint there are 3x1 streetmarkets with a smaller range as well.
- Restaurant and Bar: Choose from 4 local recipes each. The recipes provide small buffs to Shepherds and Elders (& Extended Families with Safari to Old Enbesa).
- Airballoon Tour: In order to provide its service, this building needs sails as input.
- Souvenir Shop: In order to provide its service, this building needs chronicles, tapestries and ceramics as inputs.
- Nationalpark (see below for details)

**4.** Nationalpark: Consists of its Main Building and its modules:

- The Main Building provides its service via street range. By default this range is very short, so you are forced to build Nationalpark Modules.
- There are 10 different modules, representing the different biomes of Enbesa: Miombo Woodlands, Teeming Lakes, Proud Savannah, Enbesan Highlands and Great Desert.
- Each module on an island increases the public service range of each Main Building on an island. The current range buff is shown via infotip when you click on a Main Building.
- Additionally, to force you to build different modules, each of them provide a different hotspot need. Like in the Old World, hotspot needs are provided by bus: Connect the Pier, your Nationalpark modules and your Lodge modules via bus to fullfill your tourist's hotspot needs. This is your actual "Safari" through a Nationalpark.

**5.** Bus: To establish a bus connection between the Pier, Nationalpark modules and Lodge modules build bus stops. When you first build a bus stop, Ketema should prompt you to click on a bus stop and change the bus skin to the Safari Bus.

**6.** To annoy you a bit, Lodge modules and Nationalpark modules are not for free. Both require build permits which can be obtained by the Tourism Authority. By assigning different tasks to it, you can:

- discover wildlife hotspots aka build permits for Nationalpark modules
- develop build permits to construct more lodge modules (at game start you get 3 for free)
- acquire specialists who can work in Enbesa

**7.** If you want to decorate your lodge complexes or nationalparks, you can choose from some dedicated tourist ornaments. Some ornaments have variations (Ctrl V) or skins. Vanilla ornaments now also provide a small amount of attractiveness.

**8.** When you have built at least 20 Nationalpark Modules, all of your Old (and New) World Tourists who are provided with a Tourism Pier will now also be provided with a Zoo. They rather go on a Safari :D

**Unlock**

- Enbesa Tourism gets unlocked at 4.000 tourists in the Old World AND 300 Scholars in the Old World.
- This ensures, that there is no mess with vanilla tourist quests and that all necessary products to fulfill Enbesa tourist basic needs are already unlocked.
