# Old World Chapels (Lion053)

**Building**

- This mod adds a small 3x3 sized chapel and a 3x5 sized chapel from Anno 1404 to the farmers menu.
- The chapels provide the public service "Church".
- Farmers demand this need at 200 farmers.
- By default the range of the chapels is significantly lower than the range of the church.

**"I mod your Anno" tweaks**

- You can adjust the public service range.

## Credits

All credits for the Anno 1404 chapel goes to Shane868, who upscaled the Anno 1404 textures, and to Fishboss, who imported the model from 1404 to 1800.

## Changelog

**1.2**
