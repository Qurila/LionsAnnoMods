# Local Department Variation - Knight's Castle (Lion053)

**Building**

- This mod adds a knight's castle as a variation for the Local Department.
- Intention is to have a building which fits better to agricultural dominated islands and / or old towns.
- Properties / values ​​are exactly the same as in the local vanilla department except for an extra attractivity of 120 by default.
- This means, the castle is unlocked when you build a palace and one castle per island is allowed by default.
- The tile size of the building is not completely square, at two corners you can overbuild the ground texture with ornaments.

**"I mod your Anno" mod-manager tweaks**

- You can adjust the attractivity the castle provides from 0 to 200 (default 120)
- You can decide if you want to allow the castle one time per island (default) or as many times as you want via toggle

**Menu Location:**

- Regular version: Palace Menu --> next to the vanilla Local Department
- Ornamental version: Grand Palace menu from "[Ornamental] Grand Palace" mod

## Changelog

**1.3**

- Adds an ornamental version. To use it you need the mod "[Ornamental] Grand Palace" from "Spice it Up" on mod.io, since it is added to that construction menu.
- Add Chinese translation, thanks to hanthe2th!
